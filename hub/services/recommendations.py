"""Recommendations engine for task readiness.

Given a DoR evaluation (#36) and the readiness scoring config (#37),
this module produces a sorted, actionable list of suggestions for the
human or AI Analyst preparing the task.

Design choices:
- We do NOT generate recommendations for risks. Risks already cost
  score in the readiness calculator; suggesting "remove this risk"
  would either be dishonest (you can't wish risks away) or trivial
  ("write a better mitigation"). Mitigation quality lives at task
  authoring level, not in the engine.
- We do NOT use an LLM. Every message is a deterministic template.
  This keeps recommendations cheap, repeatable, and reviewable.
- ``expected_score_delta`` mirrors the ReadinessConfig penalty so the
  numbers shown to a user actually match what the score would become
  after fixing the field.

# Static templates per check key. ``field`` is the task field a user
# would edit to satisfy the check; ``minutes`` is a rough per-item
# effort hint shown to the author. The total time to refine a task is
# NOT a sum of these numbers — many recommendations share context and
# can be answered together. Treat ``minutes`` as a per-step upper
# bound, never as a scheduling input.
#
# Style guide for ``message``:
#   1) Tell the author what to do (verb-first).
#   2) Tell them WHY in plain English (no internal jargon like
#      "verifiable_by", "DoR", "WIP" without expansion).
#   3) Give a concrete example so the author isn't blocked on form.
