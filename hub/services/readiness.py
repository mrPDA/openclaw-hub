"""Readiness calculator.

Deterministic, non-LLM scoring of how ready a task is to be picked up by
a Developer agent. The score is a flat 0..100 number computed from:

- the DoR evaluation (#36) — penalty per failed required/optional check;
- the explicit risk list on the task — penalty per risk by severity.

Defaults were chosen so that an entirely empty feature task lands near
zero and a fully-described feature with no risks is exactly 100. The
constants live in ``ReadinessConfig`` so the gate can be tuned later
without touching the algorithm.

Recommendations are intentionally produced by a separate engine (#38).
This module exposes only the score, the DoR result echoed back, and the
risk list — Recommendations consumes that output to suggest actions.

    - a high risk outweighs a missing required check (15 > 10) — the
      review explicitly flagged the prior 8<10 ordering as inverted
      severity, so risks now dominate;
    - missing optional checks are noticeable (5 pts) but not blocking;
