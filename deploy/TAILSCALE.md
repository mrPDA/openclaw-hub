# Multi-user Hub on a fresh VM via Tailscale

Operations guide for running OpenClaw Hub for a small team. The combination is:

1. **Tailscale** for the network — every developer's machine and the VM join the same private tailnet, no public ports, no certificates.
2. **Bearer-token auth** built into the Hub (`OPENCLAW_HUB_TOKENS`) — every request is attributed to a real user.
3. **Streamable-HTTP MCP** mounted at `/mcp` — Cursor connects via `https://hub.tailnet/mcp` (or `http://` over Tailscale) using the same token.

This guide assumes Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04. Other distros are similar.

---

## 1. Prepare the VM

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3.11 python3.11-venv git curl
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create the runtime user (avoid running as `root`):

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash openclaw
sudo -u openclaw -i
```

## 2. Tailscale

On the VM:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up --ssh --hostname=openclaw-hub
```

Approve the device in the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines).
Note the assigned MagicDNS name (e.g. `openclaw-hub.tailXXXX.ts.net`) — that is the URL the team will use.

On every developer machine: install Tailscale, sign in to the same tailnet,
verify reachability:

```bash
ping openclaw-hub
```

> No firewall ports need to be opened on the VM — Tailscale uses NAT
> traversal. The Hub binds to `0.0.0.0:8080` but is only reachable from
> the tailnet because no public route exists.

## 3. Install the Hub

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mrPDA/openclaw-hub.git ~/openclaw-hub
cd ~/openclaw-hub
uv sync
```

## 4. Issue tokens

Pick a random token per developer (`openssl rand -hex 24`), build the env:

```bash
cat > ~/.openclaw-hub.env <<'EOF'
OPENCLAW_HUB_TOKENS=denis:dXX...,alice:aYY...,bob:bZZ...
OPENCLAW_HUB_DB_PATH=/home/openclaw/hub.db
OPENCLAW_HUB_PORT=8080
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw-hub.env
```

Tokens are environment-driven on purpose for the MVP — to add or revoke a
user, edit the file and restart the service. A future task will move this
into the database.

## 5. systemd service

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/openclaw-hub.service
[Unit]
Description=OpenClaw Hub
After=network-online.target tailscaled.service
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=openclaw
WorkingDirectory=/home/openclaw/openclaw-hub
EnvironmentFile=/home/openclaw/.openclaw-hub.env
ExecStart=/home/openclaw/openclaw-hub/.venv/bin/openclaw-hub
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now openclaw-hub
sudo systemctl status openclaw-hub
journalctl -u openclaw-hub -f
```

Look for `Hub auth ENABLED (N token(s) configured)` in the log — that
confirms the env was picked up and the gate is active.

## 6. Verify

From a developer machine:

```bash
TOKEN=dXX...
HUB=http://openclaw-hub:8080

# Public probe — must work without a token
curl -fsS $HUB/healthz

# Protected — must 401 without a token
curl -i $HUB/api/tasks | head -1   # → HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

# Protected — must 200 with the token
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $HUB/api/tasks | head
```

In the browser, visit `http://openclaw-hub:8080/`. You will be bounced to
`/login`; paste the same token, and the dashboard opens.

## 7. Connect Cursor (MCP over Streamable-HTTP)

In each developer's `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openclaw-hub": {
      "url": "http://openclaw-hub:8080/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer dXX..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cursor will negotiate Streamable-HTTP transport against the mounted
`/mcp` endpoint. Multiple developers connect concurrently; each request
is attributed to their token via `request.state.user`.

> The previous stdio-over-SSH transport keeps working for emergency
> single-user access. Both can coexist.

## 8. Day-2 operations

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Add / rotate a token | edit `~/.openclaw-hub.env`, then `sudo systemctl restart openclaw-hub` |
| Tail logs | `journalctl -u openclaw-hub -f` |
| Health check | `curl http://openclaw-hub:8080/healthz` |
| Backup DB | `cp /home/openclaw/hub.db /home/openclaw/hub.db.$(date +%F)` |
| Disable auth temporarily | set `OPENCLAW_HUB_AUTH_DISABLED=1`, restart — never leave on |
| Remove a developer | drop their pair from `OPENCLAW_HUB_TOKENS`, restart, ask them to clear cookies |

## 9. When to graduate to production-grade auth

Move tokens from env to the database (`users` table + CLI + roles + UI)
when one of these is true:

- A new developer needs read-only access and you cannot express that with
  the current "everyone authenticated == full access" model.
- A token has leaked and you want a per-user revocation audit trail.
- The team has > 5 active developers and rotating env vars is friction.
- An external auditor wants centralised user management.

Until then, env-driven tokens are simpler, safer (no DB attack surface
for credentials) and equally functional.
